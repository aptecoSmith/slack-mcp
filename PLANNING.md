# Slack MCP Server Planning Document

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Slack integration using Python. The server will enable AI models to access and process Slack data efficiently, handling large data responses that would typically exceed LLM context limits.

## Problem Statement
Current Slack MCP implementations struggle with processing large API responses (e.g., only processing 3 users when requesting all users). This limitation occurs because the JSON responses from Slack APIs can be too large for LLM context windows.

## Technical Approach

### Core Architecture
1. **Python-based MCP Server**: Implement a server that follows the Model Context Protocol specification
2. **Chunking and Pagination**: Design a system to handle large Slack API responses through chunking and pagination
3. **Stateful Processing**: Maintain state between requests to allow processing of large datasets across multiple interactions
4. **Caching Layer**: Implement caching to reduce redundant API calls and improve performance

### Key Components
1. **Slack API Client**: Wrapper around Slack's API with pagination handling
2. **MCP Protocol Handler**: Implementation of MCP specification for request/response handling
3. **Data Processing Pipeline**: System to process, filter, and transform Slack data
4. **State Management**: Mechanism to maintain context across multiple requests
5. **Response Generator**: Component to format responses according to MCP specification

### Technologies
- **Python 3.9+**: Core programming language
- **FastAPI**: Web framework for the MCP server
- **Slack SDK**: Official Python client for Slack API
- **Redis**: For caching and state management
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment
- **Pytest**: For testing

## Data Handling Strategy
To address the core challenge of handling large API responses:

1. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for large datasets
2. **Chunked Processing**: Break large responses into manageable chunks
3. **Pagination Automation**: Automatically handle pagination for Slack API endpoints
4. **Selective Data Retrieval**: Implement filtering to retrieve only necessary data
5. **Incremental Processing**: Process data incrementally rather than all at once

### Handling Large Slack API Responses
For methods like `users.list` that return large amounts of data:
1. Implement cursor-based pagination using Slack API's cursor parameters
2. Store partial results in a cache with a unique request ID
3. Allow clients to request data in manageable chunks with continuation tokens
4. Provide metadata about total available data and current position

## MCP Implementation Details

### Server Features
The Slack MCP server will implement the following MCP features:
1. **Resources**: Provide access to Slack data (users, channels, messages)
2. **Tools**: Enable actions like sending messages, creating channels, etc.

### Protocol Compliance
The server will follow the MCP specification by:
1. Implementing the JSON-RPC 2.0 message format
2. Supporting capability negotiation
3. Handling request/response lifecycle
4. Providing proper error reporting

## Security Considerations
1. **API Token Management**: Secure storage and handling of Slack API tokens
2. **Rate Limiting**: Respect Slack API rate limits
3. **Data Privacy**: Ensure sensitive information is handled appropriately
4. **Authentication**: Secure the MCP server endpoints

## Deployment Strategy
1. **Containerization**: Package the application using Docker
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement automated testing and deployment
3. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring for the server
4. **Scaling**: Design for horizontal scaling if needed
